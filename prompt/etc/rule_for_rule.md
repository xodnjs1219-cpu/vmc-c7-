- **Code Examples:**

  - Use language-specific code blocks

  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;

  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**

  - Write in english
  - Use prompt engineering techniques
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules
  - Skip typical guideline (e.g., Clean Code)
  - Prefer terse bullet points over full sentences (i.e., shorter is better)

- **Rule Maintenance:**

  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules
